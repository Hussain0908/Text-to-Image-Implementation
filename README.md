# Text-to-Image-Implementation
This app takes in an input of text and generates an image based on the input.

Using the huggingface's model "stable-diffusion-v1-4" which is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.
To implement this model we use Python to import all dpendencies which include the huggingaface token to use the model.

This application requires a graphics card which has at least 4gb of VRAM. The graphics card uses Nvidias CUDA to run the image processing. 
Other dependencies include pytorch, PILLOW, & tkinter.
